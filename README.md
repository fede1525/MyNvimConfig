## My personal configuration for neovim

A rather minimalistic configuration using only what I believe are strictly necessary utilities.

#### Using:
- eslint, tsserver,  pywright, rust-analyzer, clangd, jdtls, lua and vim-script LSPs.
- Treesitter
- Telescope
- Lualine
- Vim-fugitive
- Melange colorscheme  (and Monokai as alternative)
